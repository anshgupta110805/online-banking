📘 Project Title: Online Banking System – Database Management Project

📍 Project Overview: This project presents a comprehensive design and implementation of a Database Management System (DBMS) tailored for an Online Banking System. It simulates the core functionalities required by modern banks to manage customer information, account details, transactions, loan services, employees, and customer support in a secure and efficient manner.

The database not only supports the day-to-day operations of a bank but also provides a strong foundation for future scaling, data analysis, and integration with web-based or mobile banking platforms.

🎯 Objectives:

Design a relational database to handle core banking activities.

Implement data integrity using constraints and relationships.

Support CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Enable data aggregation and reporting through SQL queries.

Demonstrate entity relationships through an ER diagram.

📊 Entities and Schema:

The system consists of the following main entities (tables):

Customers

Stores personal and contact details of banking customers.

Accounts

Holds information about customer accounts including balance and account type.

Transactions

Logs every deposit, withdrawal, or transfer with timestamp and associated accounts.

Loans

Contains data on loan types, status, amount, and interest rates for each customer.

Employees

Maintains details about bank employees who may assist with customer support.

Customer Support

Tracks customer complaints/issues and links them with employees.

🧩 Relationships:

A customer can own multiple accounts (One-to-Many).

An account can have multiple transactions (One-to-Many).

A customer can apply for multiple loans (One-to-Many).

A customer can raise multiple support tickets (One-to-Many).

An employee can handle multiple support tickets (One-to-Many).

🧠 Key Features Implemented:

✔ Normalized Tables with Constraints:

Primary and foreign keys enforce data integrity.

Unique constraints on emails and phone numbers.

Check constraints on amount and interest_rate fields.

✔ Sample Data Insertion:

Populated with sample customers, accounts, transactions, loans, and employees.

✔ SQL Queries Executed:

Selection: View specific or filtered data (e.g., active accounts, large transactions).

Insertion: Add new customers, accounts, or transactions.

Update: Modify account balances or transaction statuses.

Deletion: Remove customer or transactional data.

Joins: Combine data from multiple tables (e.g., customers with accounts or loans).

Aggregation: Perform statistical analysis (e.g., total balances, average loan amount).

🗂 Example Queries:

Total amount in all accounts.

Customers with their total number of transactions.

Active loans with customer names.

Transactions above a specified amount.

Accounts joined with customer profiles.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used:

MySQL or PostgreSQL (RDBMS)

SQL (DDL & DML statements)

ER Diagram Design Tool (e.g., dbdiagram.io, Draw.io)

🧾 Conclusion:

This project showcases the practical application of relational database concepts in a real-world financial environment. It demonstrates how structured data, relationships, and SQL queries can together enable efficient management of complex banking operations. With a scalable schema, strong integrity constraints, and comprehensive query coverage, the system is ready to be the backend of a full-fledged banking software solution.

📌 Potential Enhancements:

Implement triggers for automated balance updates.

Add views for reporting dashboards.

Connect this database to a front-end web or mobile application.

Integrate role-based access control (RBAC) for security.
